# NeuralNetwork

This is a (so far) failed attempt at a neural network 
for image classification with the cifar-10 set.

It can classify images using ReLUs with appropriately initialized weights,
it also implements batch norm successfully.

It can even optimize to minimize loss.

But somewhere along the line i failed, even though the loss decreases, classification is not improving, I've gotten a maximum of 14% correct so far...
